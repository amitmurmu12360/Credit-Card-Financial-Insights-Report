## Introduction
In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of credit card transaction data to uncover patterns and trends that can inform business strategies. We developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that presents key metrics on a weekly basis, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on up-to-date insights.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:
- Data : Contains raw and processed data files.
- Notebooks : Jupyter notebooks with detailed steps for data acquisition, EDA, and modeling.
- Dashboard : Power BI dashboard files and reports.
- Scripts : Python scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
- Reports : Documentation and summaries of the findings.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation
-  Data Source : The credit card transaction data was obtained from [a SQL database, CSV files].
-  Cleaning & Preprocessing : The data was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Transformations and aggregations were applied to prepare the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-  Objective : To understand data distribution, identify patterns, and uncover potential correlations.
-  Visualizations : Various charts and graphs (histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices) were created to analyze key metrics like revenue, transaction count, and interest earned.
-  Key Drivers : Identified key drivers of customer behavior and spending patterns.

## Data Modeling and Analysis
-  Modeling : Developed statistical models to analyze customer segmentation and behavior.
-  KPIs : Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and churn rate.

## Dashboard Development
-  Overview : The interactive Power BI dashboard is a key deliverable of this project, providing a weekly report with data aggregated at the card category level.
-  Metrics : Key metrics include revenue, transaction count, interest earned, and client count.
- Breakdowns : Detailed breakdowns by gender, job title, education level, and income group are included.
- Interactivity : Filters and slicers are incorporated for dynamic exploratory analysis.

## Key Findings and Insights
-  Top-Performing Categories :
-  High-Potential Segments : 

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were made:
-  Marketing Strategies : Targeted campaigns for high-potential customer segments.
-  Product Offerings : Customized product offerings to meet the needs of different customer segments.
-  Retention Strategies : Implement customer retention strategies to reduce churn.

## Tools and Technologies
-  Programming Languages : Python
-  Data Storage and Retrieval : SQL
-  Data Visualization : Power BI
-  Libraries Used : Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
